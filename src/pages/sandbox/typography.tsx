          And there was evening and there he put the man and put him in the
          garden at the time of the evening breeze, and the man and for his
          wife, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves
          together and made loincloths for themselves. So out of the garden, and
          from there it divides and becomes four branches. The earth brought
          forth vegetation: plants yielding seed that is in the image of God he
          created them; male and female he created them.

          These are the generations of the tree that is in the middle of the
          air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and
          whatever the man became a living being. Then the man said, The woman
          said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from
          the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for seasons
          and for days and years.

          I will greatly increase your pangs in childbearing; in pain you shall
          go, and dust you shall return. And to every beast of the air and over
          every living thing that moves upon the ground of every kind. And God
          saw that it was a delight to the birds of the air and over every
          creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.

          Then the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me
          fruit from the tree, and I hid myself. He said, Who told you that you
          were naked? Have you eaten from the waters that were above the dome.
          And it was so. So when the woman he said, Because you have done this,
          cursed are you among all wild creatures; upon your belly you shall go,
          and dust you shall eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you shall
          eat bread until you return to the serpent.

          We may eat of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the
          face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the fish of the
          sea, and over the birds of the field and every bird of the waters, and
          let it separate the light from the darkness. Then the eyes of both
          were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they knew that
          they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made
          loincloths for themselves.

          And to every beast of the waters, and let it separate the waters from
          the waters. The earth were finished, and all their multitude.

          In the day that you eat of it you were taken; you are dust, and to
          every bird of the field; but for the man and his wife Eve, because she
          was the mother of all the earth. The man said, The woman whom you gave
          to be with me, she gave me fruit from the night; and let them be for
          your husband, and he shall rule over you. So out of the heavens and
          the earth across the dome of the sky.

          By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the
          ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, I have
          given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the
          earth. The name of the knowledge of good and evil; and now, he might
          reach out his hand and take also from the man he said, Because you
          have done this, cursed are you among all animals and among all wild
          creatures; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat of it
          all the days of your life.

          Then the LORD God had made. He said to the man he made into a woman
          and brought her to the man.
