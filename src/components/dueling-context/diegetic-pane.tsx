      <P>“Did you get another woman analyst?”</P>

        “No. They assigned me a man. At first, I was contemptuous of him. I
        thought him a dull mediocrity. I found him pedestrian. I regarded his
        work as hack, textbook stuff. Well, it wasn’t hack, it wasn’t textbook.
        His work turned out to be of extremely high quality. My second analysis
        turned out to be much more thorough, much more profound than the first.
        But I didn’t know that at the time. My initial attitude was ‘Who are
        you? I’ve never heard of your name, even in the literature. You’re not
        famous.’ You see, my first analyst had been famous. He was a very
        brilliant and charming old man—an Austrian Jew of the first generation
        of analysts after Freud—who had come to this country during the big
        exodus of European analysts in the thirties. He didn’t keep the analytic
        incognito very much. He was a good deal more casual about it than my
        second analyst, and was much more demonstrative, expressive, and
        supportive. His analyst had been Sandor Ferenczi, and he idealized him.
        There was a bust of Ferenczi in his consultation room, together with one
        of Freud, who had analyzed Ferenczi. I could thus trace my analytic
        lineage back to Freud. You smile, and you should. It’s a preposterous
        notion. It’s the most primitive kind of family romance—my parents are
        aristocrats, I’m descended from royalty, all that sort of stuff. I know
        that now. But I didn’t then, and you’d be surprised by the number of
        people in and out of establishment psychoanalysis who hold to these
        childish fancies about their royal descent.”

        I asked Aaron what he meant by “establishment” psychoanalysis. He
        explained that in this country the establishment is formed of the
        institutes that are recognized by the American Psychoanalytic
        Association, which came into existence in 1911, three years after the
        International Psycho-Analytical Association was organized by Freud in
        Europe.

        Non-doctors who wish to practice psychoanalysis in this country get
        their training at what Aaron (with unabashed snobbery and an admitted
        total lack of justification) calls the “fly-by-night” institutes.

        “But the schism was years ago,” I said. “What’s the matter with them
        now?”

        Aaron frowned, and said in a low, dark voice, “They’re sharp dressers.”
      </P>
      <P>I laughed. “Is that all?”</P>
      <P>
        “Isn’t that enough?” Aaron said. He laughed, too. “Do they tell you how
        to dress at the New York Psychoanalytic?”
