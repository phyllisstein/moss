        The regulations and standards of the American are stricter and stiffer
        than those of the International, which oversees the analytic institutes
        and societies of the rest of the world. Aaron believes that American
        psychoanalysis is a great cut above psychoanalysis elsewhere in the
        world; he is contemptuous of what he calls the laxness and sloppiness of
        English, European, and South American analysis. There are other people,
        naturally, who are unimpressed by American analysis and are critical of
        the American Psychoanalytic Association’s iron hold over the profession.
        The most controversial of the American’s regulations is the one that, in
        effect, requires members to be medical doctors. The rule was laid down
        in 1923 in the belief that alignment with the medical establishment
        would give the struggling new profession the respectability it needed.
        It gave it that, but debate continues on whether too much wasn’t
        sacrificed by this strategy—whether too many good people who are
        unwilling to go through medical training aren’t being lost to analysis.
        Some of the greatest names in psychoanalysis were laymen—Anna Freud,
        Erik Erikson, Ernst Kris, to name the most celebrated. The International
        leaves the question to the discretion of the individual institutes, and
        most do not require that their members be doctors. Freud himself was
        opposed to the medical requirement, arguing (in a pamphlet called The
        Question of Lay Analysis, written in 1926 on the occasion of a lawsuit
        by the Austrian government against a non-medical colleague, Theodor
        Reik) that training in the care of bodies has little bearing on the
        treatment of souls. Philip Rieff, in The Triumph of the Therapeutic
        (1966), points with bitter malice to what he sees as the evil
        consequences of the medical requirement:

          More often than not, the contemporary candidate for training in one of
          the institutes now comes straight out of a medical school with
          precisely the wrong kind of education, for which a reading of Freud’s
          case histories and various other courses in the development and
          structure of psychoanalysis cannot compensate. The early
          psychoanalysts were educated men when they gathered around Freud; the
          contemporary psychoanalyst is not an educated man when he leaves the
          institute…. By default, the institutes have become what most of their
          students ardently desire them to be: trade schools preparing them for
          accreditation and the good life in some suburb, without night calls
          from troublesome patients.

        { /* Non-doctors who wish to practice psychoanalysis in this country get
        their training at what Aaron (with unabashed snobbery and an admitted
        total lack of justification) calls the “fly-by-night” institutes.*/ }
        These include institutes founded by revisionists, such as the Karen
        Horney Institute and the William Alanson White Institute, as well as
        those set up specifically to accommodate non-doctors, such as the
        National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis, founded in 1946
        by Reik, who had emigrated here. The situation is a messy, incoherent
        one, difficult for the person who is looking for an analyst to make his
        way through. And this is to say nothing of the back street of dubious
        and outright fraudulent therapies beckoning to the person in desperate
        straits.

        Within the establishment, in addition to the New York Psychoanalytic
        Institute, New York has the N.Y.U. Psychoanalytic Institute (formerly
        the Downstate Institute), peaceably founded in 1949 by Sandor Lorand, of
        the New York Psychoanalytic, and the Columbia University Center for
        Psychoanalytic Training and Research, painfully wrested from the New
        York Psychoanalytic in 1944 by Sandor Rado, in a savage schism whose
        scars are apparently still borne by both institutes. Aaron’s attitude
        toward the N.Y.U. Institute is that of an older sibling toward a younger
        brother: affectionate, tolerant, a bit condescending toward the boy’s
        evident immaturity, and admiring and envious of his dash and style and
        charm. For Columbia, the no-good son, he has nothing but bitterness and
        scorn.
